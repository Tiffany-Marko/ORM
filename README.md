# ORM
This is a database designed to track e-commerce

A database name can be added in addition to a username and password

When a command is entered to invoke the application, the server is started and models are synced to a database

When a GET route is opened in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the corresponding data is displayed

Insomnia will allow a user to edit, update, delete, or create new products in the existing database.
